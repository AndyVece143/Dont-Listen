This is the repository for our second game for IGME 320, Don't Listen.  We were tasked with creating a puzzle game set in the world of The Mishenchanted in five weeks.

# Gameplay

This game is a first-person puzzle game.  You can move, jump, pick up, and place objects.  You must investigate your surroundings to solve the puzzles, either by activating levers, or placing certain objects into place.
